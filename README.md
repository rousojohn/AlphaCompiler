AlphaCompiler
=============

Compiler for the programming language Alpha, which is a subset of the Delta programming language.

A project I developed with 2 fellow-students as a undergraduate student on Computer Science at the Univerity of Crete.
It has some bugs on the Virtual Machine that runs the executables and they won't be fixed as the project is discontinued.
